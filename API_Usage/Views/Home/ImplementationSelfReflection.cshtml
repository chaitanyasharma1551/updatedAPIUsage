<h2>Implementation</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        We explored IEX Trading website and the GitHub code shared by the professor for getting insights about the stocks and the MVC model. After researching and brainstorming about it, we took following API's
        <ul>
            <li /> Market - This endpoint returns near real time traded volume on the markets.
            <li />Dividend - 1 year of Historical market data
            <li />History - Will return the current month’s stats.
            <li />ShortInterest - The consolidated market short interest positions in all IEX-listed securities. 

        </ul>
        <br />
        We created a new function in the controller which would extract all the API's.Then we programmed a model which would extract the required information from IEX Trading website. After getting all the necessary information we created a new view to display the data.
